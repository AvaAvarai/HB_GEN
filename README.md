# HB_GEN

ðŸš§ Prototype system for HyperBlock-based classification model generation and early-stage evaluation across benchmark datasets.

## Project Goal

Achieve comparable performance with hyperblock models as to that of a Convolutional Neural Network on full real data i.e. MNIST.

### Datasets Used

- Fisher Iris (4-D): Quick testing
- WBC (9-D and 30-D): Benchmark testing
- Dimensionally Reduced MNIST (121-D): Initial goal
- MNIST (784-D): Top-level goal
